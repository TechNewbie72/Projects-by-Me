<p>I first fell in love with photography almost ten years ago. After experiencing a difficult time in my life, I decided to take a trip to San Diego in December 2011. Instantly I was drawn not only to the warm waters, sandy beaches, and great climate but also to the beauty of southern California. I wanted to somehow capture those moments forever and what better way than through photography. 
    <hr>Upon my return home I decided to do some research into what was the best camera. I found myself attracted to the DSLRs and Canon. While the cameras can be a bit pricey, nevertheless I went with one that was in my price point.</p></head>
